    By **2030**, the world is expected to generate over **2.6 billion tons of waste** every year.  
    Current waste management systems are inefficient and suffer from:

    - **Manual human sorting** that handles only 1‚Äì2 items per second
    - **High processing costs** of **$50‚Äì$100 per ton**
    - **Contamination and classification error rates** between **15‚Äì25%**

    These inefficiencies lead to:
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è **High contamination rates**
    - üí∏ **Increased processing costs**
    - ‚ôªÔ∏è **Reduced recycling efficiency**

    To address these challenges, our team built an **AI-powered waste classifier** based on **ResNet50**.

    The app uses computer vision to classify household or industrial waste images into six key categories:

    - **Cardboard**
    - **Glass**
    - **Metal**
    - **Paper**
    - **Plastic**
    - **Trash**

    This makes sorting faster, cheaper, and more reliable.

    - **Automates classification**, eliminating the need for slow human sorting
    - **Improves accuracy**, reducing contamination and error rates
    - **Cuts costs** by optimizing the processing chain
    - **Boosts recycling efficiency**, contributing to sustainability goals

    In short, our solution leverages AI to make waste management **smarter, greener, and more scalable**.
